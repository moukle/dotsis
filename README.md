# Dotsis

Got [frustrated](https://github.com/moukle/.nix/tree/battlestation) of [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) and went back to Arch / [CachyOS](https://github.com/cachyos).
Still wanted a setup where I could hit one command on a fresh install and be set again.

## Packages

Packages are defined in `.setup/packages.sh`.
They are grouped in a way that allows picking individual sections, which is extremely useful when using environments like WSL.

[Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) will symlink these dotfiles:

```shell
$ eza --tree --level=2 .

.
â”œâ”€â”€ cli
â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ neovim         # editor
â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ python-pywal   # color templating
â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ starship       # prompt
â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ yazi           # file manager
â”‚  â””â”€â”€ zsh            # shell
â”œâ”€â”€ gaming
â”‚  â””â”€â”€ ddnet          # best game
â”œâ”€â”€ gui
â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ code           # editor
â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ kitty          # terminal
â”‚  â”œâ”€â”€ zathura        # pads
â”‚  â””â”€â”€ zed-editor     # editor

   â”œâ”€â”€ dunst          # notifications
   â”œâ”€â”€ hyprland       # window manager
   â”œâ”€â”€ matugen-bin    # managing colors
   â”œâ”€â”€ niri-git       # portals not working
   â””â”€â”€ waybar         # bar
```

## Install

To install, run:

```shell
cd .setup
./setup.sh
```

This will guide you through the installation thanks to [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) ðŸª„.
